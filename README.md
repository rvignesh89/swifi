# Swifi

A smart wireless manager for windows running on [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/).

## Usage

Once you run the Swifi.exe it will automatically hide and create an icon in the System Tray. When you have moved to a different work area you can right click on the Swifi tray icon which should display the option to Move. Upon clicking that your wireless adapter will be disabled and re-enabled forcing it to automatically connect to the strongest wireless router closest to you at that point.

### Note

* Wireless networks will be automatically connected only if you have enabled them to be so.
* Swifi has be to be run as an Admin in order for it to function properly.

### Future Plan

* Sticky Wifi - Given your workspace has multiple wireless routers with the same SSID, this feature allows you to
intelligently move your connect to a different router based on the signal strength
* Display strength of available networks and giving you the ability to connect to them from inside Swifi.
* Support Mac (Need to research if there are suitable commands)
